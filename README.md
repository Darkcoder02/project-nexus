# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Step to Run the app:
1 - Clone the repo into your local machine
2 - Go to the project-nexus directory
3 - Run npm install
4 - To access the Home Page without authentication, use URL: localhost:5137/home
5 - The server file is located within the project-nexus folder
6 - To start the server, run npm run start
